## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Guidelines

### **Consistent Patterns to Follow**

1. **View Mode Enum Pattern:**
   ```go
   type ScreenViewMode int
   const (
       ViewList ScreenViewMode = iota
       ViewForm
       ViewDetails
       ViewConfirm
   )
   ```

2. **Form State Management:**
   ```go
   type FormModel struct {
       // Input fields
       // Validation state
       // Focus management
       editing bool
       editingID *uuid.UUID
   }
   ```

3. **Message Types:**
   ```go
   type dataLoadedMsg struct { /* data */ }
   type actionCompletedMsg struct{}
   type errMsg struct { err error }
   ```

4. **Styling Consistency:**
   - Use existing style package
   - Follow color scheme (Primary, Success, Danger, Info)
   - Consistent spacing and borders
   - Form validation styling

### **Key Features Already Available in Backend**

- âœ… **Automatic Balance Updates:** Transactions automatically update account/card balances
- âœ… **Shared Expense Logic:** Split transactions equally or by percentage
- âœ… **Bill Auto-Assignment:** Transactions automatically assigned to appropriate bills
- âœ… **Credit Card Management:** Charge/payment with limit validation
- âœ… **Rich Domain Validation:** Business rules enforced at entity level
- âœ… **Money Value Object:** Currency-aware calculations

### **Form Mode Integration**

Each new screen should implement the `FormModeChecker` interface:
```go
type FormModeChecker interface {
    IsInFormMode() bool
}
```

This ensures proper navigation behavior when users are in form editing mode.
